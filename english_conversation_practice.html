    <h2>How to Improve Your English Conversation Skills</h2>
    <p>
      If you want to improve your English conversation skills, you need to undergo the following training. 
      You may also respond by asking your partner questions again, just like in table tennis, where the fun comes 
      from hitting the ball back and forth‚Äîwhen the ball comes to you, and you return it well, the game continues with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, in English conversation, when you effectively respond to what a native speaker says, 
      the dialogue can keep going. Therefore, this method will help you learn how to conduct English 
      conversations using short question formats (Format A & B), followed by real conversation situations.
